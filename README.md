## üìä Swiggy Dashboard ‚Äì DAX Measures

## 1. Orders & Users
Total Orders = COUNTROWS(Orders)

Total Users = DISTINCTCOUNT(Users[UserID])

Top 10% Customer Contribution = 
CALCULATE(
    SUM(Sales[Amount]),
    TOPN(
        ROUNDUP(DIVIDE(COUNTROWS(Users),10,0),0),
        SUMMARIZE(Users, Users[UserID], "CustSales", SUM(Sales[Amount])),
        [CustSales],
        DESC
    )
)

## 2. Sales Performance
Total Sales = SUM(Sales[Amount])

Current Year Sales = 
CALCULATE(
    SUM(Sales[Amount]),
    YEAR(Sales[OrderDate]) = YEAR(TODAY())
)

Previous Year Sales = 
CALCULATE(
    SUM(Sales[Amount]),
    YEAR(Sales[OrderDate]) = YEAR(TODAY()) - 1
)

Sales Growth % = 
DIVIDE([Current Year Sales] - [Previous Year Sales], [Previous Year Sales], 0)

## 3. Food Category Metrics (Veg / Non-Veg / Others)
Total Veg Sales = 
CALCULATE(SUM(Sales[Amount]), Sales[FoodCategory] = "Veg")

Total NonVeg Sales = 
CALCULATE(SUM(Sales[Amount]), Sales[FoodCategory] = "Non-Veg")

Avg Price per Order = 
DIVIDE(SUM(Sales[Amount]), SUM(Sales[Quantity]))

## 4. Ratings & Feedback
Total Ratings = COUNT(Ratings[RatingID])

Avg Rating = AVERAGE(Ratings[Rating])

% of 5 Star Ratings = 
DIVIDE(
    CALCULATE(COUNTROWS(Ratings), Ratings[Rating] = 5),
    COUNTROWS(Ratings),
    0
)

## 5. City Analysis
City Wise Sales = 
SUMMARIZE(
    Cities,
    Cities[CityName],
    "TotalSales", SUM(Sales[Amount]),
    "Users", DISTINCTCOUNT(Users[UserID]),
    "Orders", COUNTROWS(Orders),
    "Ratings", COUNTROWS(Ratings)
)

## 6. Restaurant Performance
Total Restaurants = DISTINCTCOUNT(Restaurants[RestaurantID])

Top Restaurant by Rating = 
TOPN(
    1,
    SUMMARIZE(Restaurants, Restauran

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges Faced
